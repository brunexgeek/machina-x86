TODO
--------------

- Change control87() to use the MSVCRT definitions of FPU control flags.

- Implement 48-bit LBA support in IDE driver

- Improve sysalloc() in heap.c to enable dynamic expansion of wilderness region.

- Implement UDMA mode for ATAPI devices

- Replace syslog() in sysapi.c with:
    int vsyslog(int syscallno, va_list params);
    int syslog(int syscallno, ...);

- Keyboard locks up when pressing CAPSLOCK
    - Check ext flags in processing modifier keys (shift, alt, etc.)

- Implement ICMP messages host unreachable, net unreachable and port unreachable

- Finish implementation of NDIS subsystem

- Add support for shared interrupts to driver isr handlers

- Use bitmap for port number handling

- Multicast filtering support in network drivers

- Implement mremap() and use it in heap.c for realloc() of large blocks

- Implement krealloc() in kmalloc.c

- Handle reopening of files in smbfs after reconnect

- What happens if a tcp pcb is freed in tcp_input() while sending segments on another socket in tcp_output()?

- Stack underflow handling (problably with guard page)

- Minimal buffer overrun checking


==== Ideas ====

- Vulnerability test with Nessus

- Use type object in struct object

- String substitution in inf files
    - Replace all ${key} with value in [strings] section
    - Support merging of ini files

- sysctl() functionality

- DNS resolver cache

- Dynamic DNS registration

- Multiple consoles (switch consoles with ALT-<num>)

- FATFS support

- ACPI support

- Support for swap to disk/file

- Multiple processes model (change page directory at context switch)

- Multi-thread boot (for now the boot process is too fast that we don't need this)

- Window system over console (based on Haiku/BeOS?)

- Multi-processor support
